# The keys of a dictionary are very similar to a set. The main difference is that dictionary keys are ordered.
# Sets have no ordering.
# Items only appear once in a union set. The elements are unique.
# Sets are unordered. This means we cannot index a set. Items in a set don't have a fixed position.
# Python considers the sets to be equal if they contain the same items in them, the order isn't important.
