#Python 3 has 5 sequence types built in:
  #The string type
  #list
  #tuple
  #range
  #bytes and bytearray

#A sequence is defined as an ordered set of items
string1 = "He's "
string2 = "probably "
string3 = "pinning "
string4 = "for the "
string5 = "fjords."

print(string1 + string2 + string3 + string4 + string5)

#Strings can also be multiplied in python
print("Hello " * 5)
